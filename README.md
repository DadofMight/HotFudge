========

A lightweight script to enable scripting commands on 
"vanilla" Minecraft SMP servers.

Set the install directory and coords for spawn and jail, 
and you're done configuring this script. 

I recommend running this script every minute, to ensure no memory leaks, 
and provide reasonably quick response time for the players.

This script assumes you have an init.d style script for your
server, which will handle running the commands.
